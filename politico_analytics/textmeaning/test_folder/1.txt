1 The Expanding Art of the Possible


1 In lieu of much effective signaling, states have found it better to use their cyber capabilities to grapple with one another for advantage. This posts span several decades of cyber operations. This history demonstrates an important pattern: the harm that hackers can do is expanding faster than the deterrence or defenses against them. For years, increasingly aggressive activities have in many cases gone unblocked and unmet by meaningful retaliation.

1 Intelligence agencies pioneered cyber espionage operations many years ago. They poked around adversaries’ and even allies’ computer networks in secret and tapped in as data transited fiber-optic cables. These agencies, and their military partners, eventually added a parallel track of targeted attack, using the same illicit access to foreign networks to destroy and manipulate information, not just gather intelligence. Eventually, this also expanded, adding a category of operations, including widespread disruptions like NotPetya, meant to destabilize broad swaths of a targeted society. At each turn, despite protestations and a few attempts to impose consequences, the scope of cyber operations grew mostly unchecked.

1 Within each of these three categories espionage, attack, and destabilization operations continue to become more powerful and more scalable. For espionage purposes, the Chinese have hacked military targets, valuable but obscure offices in the United States, key parts of the computing supply chain, major cloud service providers with gigantic amounts of data, and many other targets\. The success of companies like Huawei in manufacturing, building, and repairing undersea cables and new 5G telecommunications infrastructure raises fears that the Chinese government may try to match the advantages in passive collection that the Five Eyes enjoy, according to statements of former government officials and leaked documents.
